# QZ #

This is a tool for the Renoise DAW.

It provides an action called "play next pattern in sequencer" that skips the playback to the beginning of the next pattern.
If the song is already playing, the currently playing samples will continue playing.
If it isn't, this action will start the playback.

This action can be triggered with a key binding or a MIDI mapping.

I use it as a "go" button, to trigger sequences like cues in the QLab software.
